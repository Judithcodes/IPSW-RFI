# IPSW-RFI
IPSW 2019 work

So far, this is just preliminary presentation stuff.

## Data structure
To check out the data structure,

`jupyter notebook` 

and select the "Exploring [...].ipynb" notebook. Then you'll have to change the `filename=....h5` line.

## Plotting bounding boxes

`plot.py ../path/to/h5File.h5 --draw_boxes`
